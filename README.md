# calculator

displayNum stores the innerText of the button pressed and updates the
innerText of the display on the calculator. The basic function is to
update the first number inputted on-screen until an operation is 
pressed, which will then store first operand and operation as a
variable. The display will update consequent numbers pressed until 
a operation or equals button is pressed, which will store the second
operand into a variable and then call the operate function with 
the provided arguments.
